# CA3_D00215674_alt
Due to recurring problems CA3 has been duplicated and will be continued in this repository

**Introduction** 
  * When CA3 was created, the first thing done was to prepare the file directories to match the MVC Pattern.
  * Index.php files were created for the initial homepage and each directory associated with it.
  
**Main Body**
  * The core of CA3 is the _PHP code_ used for accessing and manipulating data from a database.
  * The webpage is based off of Spas and the ability become a _member_ and _create booking_ at your own leisure.
  * The database consists of 3 tables: **Bookings, Members, and Vip Members**. Vip and Bookings reference the member_id in the Members         table.
  * The webpage has the ability to **Create, Read, Update, and Delete** the data for each table. Can only create in VIP and Booking if and     only if there is a member_id to reference.
  
  **Troubleshooting**
    * While creating CA3 **main.css** would be found by the network but not read. Causing the HTML to be unstyled.
    * In response to this the project was cloned to the name CA3_D00215674_alt. This finally allowed the **main.css** to be read.
    * When cloning CA3 to a new project, the push was then rejected by Github. Trying to push to the master branch with a different project 
      would not work due to unmatching IDs.
    * This github **CA3_D00215674_alt** was created because I was unable to correct the error in github from the cloned project.
